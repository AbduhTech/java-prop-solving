# QUESTION 1
The American Heart Association suggests that at most 30% of the calories in our diet come
from fat. Although food labels give the number of calories and amount of fat per serving.
They often do not give the percentage of calories from fat. This percentage can be calculated
by multiplying the number of grams of fat in one serving by 9 and dividing that number by
the total number of calories per serving. Write a program that requests the name, number of
calories per serving, and the grams per serving as input, and tells whether the food meets the
American Heart recommendation


# QUESTION 2
You are working in a small company as a programmer. You are required to design a program
to calculate the net salary of the employees working for the company. The program should be
able to do repetition based on the number of employees in the company. The table of

  The first column shows the basic salary. The second column shows the compulsory tax
incurred which will be deducted from the basic salary. The third column shows the
compulsory deduction for KWSP contribution. The fourth column shows the housing
allowance that will be paid by the company to the employee. This allowance is optional. If the
employee applied the allowance for that month, allowance will be paid; otherwise no
allowance will be paid.
 Write the Java program for this scenario. 

# QUESTION 3
Write a program that calculates the occupancy rate for a hotel. The program should start by
asking the user how many floors the hotel has. A loop should then iterate once for each floor.
In each iteration, the loop should ask the user for the number of rooms on the floor and how
many of them are occupied. After all the iterations, the program should display how many
rooms the hotel has, how many of them are occupied, how many are unoccupied, and the
percentage of rooms that are occupied. The percentage may be calculated by dividing the
number of rooms occupied by the number of rooms.
Input Validation:
  Do not accept a value less than 1 for the number of floors. 
  Do not accept a number less than 10 for the number of rooms on a floor. 



# QUESTION 4

and members using inheritance.
1. Define the class Employee, Home Address, and Place of Work with their
